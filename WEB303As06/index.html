                    <h2>Batman Begins</h2>
                    <p>Batman Begins was the first movie in the recent trilogy of Batman Films. It shows the initial introduction of Batman into Gotham city and he fights Scarecrow to defend the city.</p>

                    <h2>The Dark Knight</h2>
                    <p>The Dark Knight is the second movie, and argueably one of the best Batman movies to ever be released. This film focuses on Batman's battle with the Joker.</p>

                    <h2>The Dark Knight Rises</h2>
                    <p>The last but certainly not least film is The Dark Knight Rises. Batman faces a deep struggle to find the inner(and outer) strength to fight Bane, his final and certainly strongest enemy to date.</p>

                    <h2>The Batman</h2>
                    <p>The Batman is the newest and one of the most different takes we have seen of Batman. It is a darker, more serious film and truly follows a different path than its previous installments. Batman takes on many different foes in his earlier years establishing how we came to be.</p>
                </div> 
                <div class="tab-panel2" id="tab5">
                    <h2>The Dark Knight</h2>
                    <p>As mentioned before, Batman really goes through a test of will and attempts to come out on top. This is what makes me so interested in this movie. Normally Batman always finds a way to come out on top, but this was a new limit he had reached.</p>

                <div class="tab-panel2" id="tab6">
                    <h2>Batman</h2>
                    <p>This 1989 film did alot for the character of Batman on screen. It is a classic and deserves all of the praise. Jack Nicholson's performance as Joker could have carried the movie on its own.</p>
